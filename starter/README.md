## Description
This project was undertaken to create a CLI application that will enable a developer to easily create a professional README. This project further honed my skills with utilising Node js, Node modules and ES6. Though challenging I was able to build a functioning CLI application and this README was built using this application.

## Installation
To readily use this application, it is essential you install the npm inquirer. After installation simply type ‘node index.js’ in the terminal and you will prompted to complete and answer the questions that build each of your README sections.

## Usage
Answer each prompt to build the sections of your README. For the license question you use the arrows to toggle between each option and then press enter.

## Contributing
At the moment I am not open to contributions as I am still working on further dveloping this beta first.

## Tests
Input information as previously advised.

## License
